\begin{abstract}
%Torrenting is used to download copyrighted works from the Internet. This report gives an overview of the technology behind it, investigating how it affects the media industry. Evidence is reviewed from global studies to understand its relevance in the legal options accessible in the UK. The negative and opposing effects on the media industry are discussed alongside relevant research data from the UK. The consequence of introducing blocking measures is reviewed from supporting and opposing evidence. In conclusion there are four suggestions for more specific research and legislation related specifically to the  UK media industry.
